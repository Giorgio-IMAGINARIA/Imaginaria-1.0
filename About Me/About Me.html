                   My name is Giorgio Mazzei. I'm italian and I lived in my country for almost all my life. I studied in a technical high school where I obtained A Levels in Mathematics, Electronics and IT, afterwards I started the university path.<br/>
                   I decided to follow an experimental course in Architectural Engineering and after five years I got a master's degree in the same matter.<br/>
                   I worked as a researcher for two years developing several projects in the fields of design and engineering. Following this experience I started thinking about improving my technical knowledge, so I applied for a Civil Engineering course.<br/>
                   After one year and a half I achieved a bachelor's degree and I started working for an interesting database project for the "La Sapienza" university of Rome.<br/>
                   I'm always eager to find new ways in which to make my personal and professional life grow, therefore I left Italy and I chose the UK as my new home.

                   I live in London now and I'd like to use my skills in the software development field. My coding skills include C#, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript.<br />
                   This website is intended to be a changing showcase of my professional goals.<br/>
                   I'm always committed to applying both rationality and creativity to my projects, besides I'm also able to write complex code and to design a UX as well as developing the contemporary concepts behind a modern logo.

                   I'm willing to learn new technologies and to explore the new opportunities that their implementation could give to our lives. I'd also like to provide more professional services for my customers while following the new trends.<br/>
                   I'd be glad to work for a company operating in the IT field since it could give me the right support to expand my knowledge and deepen my research.
